Hi, I'm Gabi.

👩‍💻 Looking for my best version everyday :)

🎓 Studying Cybersecurity and Information Security at School.

📚 When I'm not studying, you'll likely find me curled up with a book, enjoying a cup of tea, or catching up on my favorite TV shows. 

💜 I'm proud to volunteer with Meninas Digitais Bahia and Stem Para Minas, both communities that supports and encourages women in STEM.

🌳 I love spending time in nature and enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring new spaces.

😻 Cats hold a special place in my heart, and I'm always happy to share stories and pictures of my feline friends.

📩 Feel free to reach out to me via email or social media if you'd like to connect, chat about tech, or collaborate on a project! (Likedin or e-mail)
