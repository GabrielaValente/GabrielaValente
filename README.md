Hi, I'm Gabi.

👩‍💻 As a front-end developer, I really like creating engaging and intuitive user experiences. Currently, I'm focusing on JavaScript, Vue.js, and React.js.

🎓 I'm also a Software Engineering student, eager to expand my knowledge and skills.

📚 When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me curled up with a book, enjoying a cup of tea, or catching up on my favorite TV shows. 

💜 I'm proud to volunteer with Meninas Digitais Bahia, a community that supports and encourages women in tech.

🌳 I love spending time in nature and enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring new spaces.

😻 Cats hold a special place in my heart, and I'm always happy to share stories and pictures of my feline friends.

📩 Feel free to reach out to me via email or social media if you'd like to connect, chat about tech, or collaborate on a project!
