Hi, I'm Gabi.

ðŸŽ“ Cybersecurity and Information Security 

ðŸ’œ I'm proud to volunteer with Meninas Digitais Bahia and Stem Para Minas, both communities that supports and encourages women in STEM.

ðŸŒ³ I love spending time in nature and enjoy hiking, camping, and exploring new spaces.

ðŸ˜» Cats hold a special place in my heart, and I'm always happy to share stories and pictures of my feline friends.
